    <string name="answer1">Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.</string>
    <string name="answer2">The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don\'t feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.</string>
    <string name="answer3">People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.</string>
    <string name="answer4">Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.</string>
    <string name="answer5">The risk depends on where you  are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.</string>
    <string name="answer7">"While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes)  appear to develop serious illness more often than others. "</string>
    <string name="answer9">No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different.</string>
    <string name="answer6">Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.</string>
    <string name="answer8">"No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection. "</string>
    <string name="answer11">"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed.  "</string>
    <string name="answer10">The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available.</string>
    <string name="answer12">"While there has been one instance of a dog being infected in Hong Kong, to date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly. "</string>
    <string name="answer14">The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:      Smoking     Wearing multiple masks     Taking antibiotics (See question 10 \"Are there any medicines of therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?\")  In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.</string>
    <string name="answer13">It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces,
        but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses
        (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few
        hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface,
        temperature or humidity of the environment).  If you think a surface may be infected, clean
        it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others.
        Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
        Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.</string>

    <string name="symptoms_title_1">What is a ‘novel’ coronavirus?</string>
    <string name="symptoms_desc_1">A novel coronavirus (CoV) is a new strain of coronavirus.  The disease caused by the novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China, has been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – ‘CO’ stands for corona, ‘VI’ for virus, and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as ‘2019 novel coronavirus’ or ‘2019-nCoV.’  The COVID-19 virus is a new virus linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and some types of common cold.</string>
    <string name="symptoms_title_2">What are the symptoms of coronavirus?</string>
    <string name="symptoms_desc_2">Symptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia or breathing difficulties. More rarely, the disease can be fatal.   These symptoms are similar to the flu (influenza) or the common cold, which are a lot more common than COVID-19. This is why testing is required to confirm if someone has COVID-19. It’s important to remember that key prevention measures are the same – frequent hand washing, and respiratory hygiene (cover your cough or sneeze with a flexed elbow or tissue, then throw away the tissue into a closed bin). Also, there is a vaccine for the flu – so remember to keep yourself and your child up to date with vaccinations.</string>
    <string name="menu_symptoms">Symptoms</string>
    <string name="scare_emergency_message">The virus is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person (generated through coughing and sneezing), and touching surfaces contaminated with the virus.</string>
    <string name="scare_emergency">How does the COVID-19 virus spread?</string>
    <string name="emergency_title_1">What should I do if a family member displays symptoms?</string>
    <string name="emergency_desc_1">You should seek medical care early if you or your child has a fever, cough or difficulty breathing. Consider calling ahead to tell your health care provider if you have traveled to an area where COVID-19 has been reported, or if you have been in close contact with someone with who has traveled from one of these areas and has respiratory symptoms</string>
    <string name="emergency_title_2">Does COVID-19 affect children?</string>
    <string name="emergency_desc_2">This is a new virus and we do not know enough yet about how it affects children or pregnant women. We know it is possible for people of any age to be infected and transmit the virus, although older people and/or those with pre-existing medical conditions seem more likely to develop serious illness.</string>
    <string name="emergency_title_4">How can I protect myself and others from COVID-19?</string>
    <string name="emergency_desc_4">Here are some precautions you and your family can take to help avoid infection:</string>
    <string name="emergency_prevent_1">Step 1: Wet hands with running water</string>
    <string name="emergency_prevent_2">Step 2: Apply enough soap to cover wet hands</string>
    <string name="emergency_prevent_3">Step 3: Scrub all surfaces of the hands – including back of hands, between fingers and under nails – for at least 20 seconds.</string>
    <string name="emergency_prevent_4">Step 4: Rinse thoroughly with running water</string>
    <string name="emergency_prevent_5">Step 5: Dry hands with a clean cloth or single-use towel</string>

    <string name="frequently">Frequently Asked Questions</string>
    <string name="frequent">The eminent Professor Woo Joo Kim, one of the leading experts on the matter answered some question on Covid-19.\n\nPress on the questions below to see the answers</string>

    <string name="q1">What is the difference between a relapse and an reinfection?</string>
    <string name="q2">If our bodies produce antibodies, shouldn\'t we not experience a reinfection?</string>
    <string name="q3">Should I take a lot of vitamins to help strengthen my immune system?</string>
    <string name="q4">How effective is wearing a mask in general?</string>
    <string name="q5">How effective are cotton masks?</string>
    <string name="q6">Why is this virus so deadly to the elderly?</string>
    <string name="q7">By which means the virus penetrates the body?</string>

    <string name="a1">Relapse is when the virus gets treated, the symptoms go away, and the patient even tests negative. But it\'s just that the number of virus copied is so small that the PCR test kit can\'t detect it. Usually you need 3,000 copies of the virus for you to test positive. If there is less than that, the test comes out as negative, even if you still have the virus... So after you get discharged, the virus will replicate again, an when it goes up from 3,000 to 5000 you will get the symptoms again so that is what relapse is... But reinfection is when you completely get rid of the virus from your body, but then get reinfected by another person with the Covid19 virus again.</string>
    <string name="a2">That\’s the part that isn\'t crystal clear. But there are studies that show that after you get infected with Covid-19,your body normally starts producing antibodies by the end of the first week. And after 2 to 3 weeks, most infectees of course there are exceptions, but more than 90% of people produce those antibodies, and we need to check whether they\'re producing antibodies that actually prevent reinfection. Out of the different types of antibodies, we need the specific antibodies that attack the virus spike proteins to neutralize the virus. Only they can prevent reinfection.</string>
    <string name="a3">No. Most people just think having a strong immune system just means being healthy. But to have immunity against Covid19, you need the specific neutralizing antibodies. If you have them, that means you have immunity to it. Most people don\'t have them. Unless you recovered from Covid9 or are currently fighting it off right now, you don\'t have immunity against it that\'s why you can get infected easily.</string>
    <string name="a4">It\’s definitely effective. According to research, medical professionals wearing masks have a significantly lower chance of getting infected than those who don\'t.</string>
    <string name="a5">In theory, a mask is supposed to protect us from the droplets of a size of microns or bigger from others coughing or sneezing. But these droplets can penetrate through cotton. In the end, wearing a cotton mask is better than nothing, but it\'s not as effective as the medical grade masks we recommend. Because the small gap in the cotton, also it\’s not fluid resistant it gets wet.</string>
    <string name="a6">Covid19 is a new virus; the only thing that can fight the virus is your own immune system. If you\'re over 60 your immune system deteriorates. It is called immunosenescence. the virus can lead to pneumonia or inflammation all over the body, the virus can put the elderly in critical states and increase the chances of death. Also those with chronic medical conditions are another high risk group. Even if they\’re under 60, if they have any cardiovascular problems, a chronic lung condition, or are smokers.</string>
    <string name="a7">You can get infected through your eyes, nose and mouth because they are mucous membranes inside them. It\’s inside your eyelids and nose. The same goes for your mouth. The virus can\'t go through the skin. These mucous membranes have a receptor called ACE2. The virus has to stick to those receptors. We don\'t have receptors on our skin. Our skin actually acts as a sort of a barrier. The virus cannot go through your ears.</string>
